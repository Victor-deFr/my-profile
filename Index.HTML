	 I'm 21 years old, and I'm passionate about sneakers 👟 and animals 🐯 ! I also love to listen music and go walking in the mountains 🥾⛰. Aftemy studies, I'd like to work in the marketing of an NGO focused on saving animal species 💚.

      <h2> Sneakers 👟 </h2>
      <p>
	  I am a great collector of sneakers. For the past 6 years, I have been following the collaborations of brands with each other or with artists. There are a lot of new models and to be able to buy as many as I want, I created a business to sell sneakers that are limited edition.

      <h2> Animals 🐯</h2>
      <p> 
	  Since I was little I love animals. I had a lot of them in my life and I also did an internship in a zoo because I was so passionate about it. I can go to areas just to hope to see a particular species.

     <h2> Professional objectives 🙌 </h2>
      <p> 
     In the future, I would really like to have a job that is also a passion. I'm thinking of maybe setting up a shoe shop in a French city. However, if I follow my heart, I would really like to do a job where I feel useful. So, thinking about it, I think that working in an NGO for the protection of animals in the world would be the best option for me.
